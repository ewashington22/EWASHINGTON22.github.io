  <div id="mainmessage">  <p>Every day, millions of us wish to transform our bodies. We seek to lose fat to be active and healthier, gain muscle to become stronger, and more. No matter what, everybody is entitled to their own motivations and body goals. This website removes all of the clutter and confusion, boiling down the path for change into a few key aspects. The pillar of ChasingFitness is that <strong> losing muscle or fat</strong> is a result of a <strong> caloric deficit </strong> while <strong>gaining muscle or fat</strong> is a result of a <strong> caloric surplus. </strong> This simple law is key to unlcoking transformations. Manipulating the three areas below will allow control over your body's weight and fat; although the strategies are simple, you must still work hard and maintain dedication!</p> 
    
   
 
 <div class="greyback"><h2 id="section1"> Resting Metabolic Rate</h2>

 
<p> Obtaining a higher resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body burns calories during a period of physical inactivity) is perhaps the most important key in promoting weight loss. The inverse is true if one wishes to gain weight. "Slow metabolisms" do in fact make it easier to gain weight. Too often, we obsess over how we can eat less or exercise more, but the reality is that we are usually at rest during the day. Therefore, the easiest way to lose weight is to make sure that the body passively burns as many calories as possible.</p>

<ol>
    <li> Building muscle naturally allows the body to burn more calories at rest. </li> 
    <li> Consistent meals prevent the body from developing a slow metabolism... <span class="caution">Don't starve yourself!</span> </li> 
</ol>
 </div>
 
<div class="greyback"> <h2 id="section2">Diet</h2>

<p> Use caloric deficit or surplus in order to manipulate your weight. This <span class="good">WILL ABSOLUTELY WORK IF ONE MAINTAINS DISCIPLINE. </span> </p> 

<ol>
    <li> Weight Loss Protocol<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Calories Per Day - If day in and day out, you consume less calories than you burn in a day, you will surely begin to lose weight. The key is to find tasty, low calorie foods so you don't fall into the trap of only eating rich, fattening foods. </li>
    <li>Consistency - Change will not happen overnight. Chip away at your weight for months and the days might go by slowly, but the loss will quickly add up. </li>
    <li class="caution">Fad Diets - <strong> AVOID FAD DIETS AT ALL COSTS. </strong> Cutting out carbs or fat or eating a superfood will not magically transform you into a skinnier person. <span class="good"> Patience and commitment to a lower caloric intake will.</span> </li>
    
    </ul>
    <li> Weight Gain Protocol </li> 
    <ul>
    <li>Calories Per Day - To gain weight, you must consume more calories than you burn in a day. These caloric surpluses will either lead to increases in fat, muscle, or both depending on how you exercise. </li>
    <li> Macronutrients - Especially if you want your new weight to be muscle, you must ensure that you balance your macronutrients while also exercising. You must tear your muscles by putting them under strain (lifting, sprinting, etc) in order to stimulate growth, and you must also eat enough protein to help your muscles to recover. It is also important to make sure you eat enough carbs in order to have energy for your workouts as well as after during recovery. </li>
    <li>Consistency - Once again, consistency is key to gaining weight, especially muscle. It is harder to gain pure muscle than it is to lose fat. This will be a long journey. </li>
    
    </ul>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="greyback"> <h2 id="section3">Exercise</h2>

<p> It is crucial to understand the effects of exercise so that your workouts can help you to achieve your weight goals.  </p> 

<ol>
    <li> Cardio - Cardio is an great way to burn some extra calories, which will ultimately help with fat loss. It is typically not great for building large amounts of muscle. Some pople expect to become "huge" from running which is simply not the case. Although "hugeness" should not be expected, cardio can lower bodyfat enough so that certain muscles such as abs can become way more visible. If you have been on a weightgain/lifting journey and have found that you have gained both muscle and fat, doing some cardio and beginning a caloric deficit can be a great way to cut the fat off and reveal your new muscle. </li> 
    <li> Lifting - Lifting can be extremely helpful for both weightloss or weight gain. Developing some muscle from lifting can be a great way to passively burn calories, which would be very beneficial for those who want to drop some pounds. Lifting can also boost testosterone, which helps to maintain lean mass and drop body fat. If one wants to lift for weight gain, it is the best way to gain muscle. Bodyweight exercises can help to gain muscle as well. What it boils down to is that muscles must be put under stress in order to tear and repair, which ultuimately creates muscle growth. Just a few lift sessions a week over a long period time can create a muscular transformation. </li>

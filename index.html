    <p>Every day, millions of us wish to transform our bodies. We seek to lose fat to be active and healthier, gain muscle to become stronger, and more. No matter what, everybody is entitled to their own motivations and body goals. This website removes all of the clutter and confusion, boiling down the path for change into a few key aspects. The pillar of ChasingFitness is that <strong> losing muscle or fat</strong> is a result of a <strong> caloric deficit </strong> while <strong>gaining muscle or fat</strong> is a result of a <strong> caloric surplus. </strong> This simple law is key to unlcoking transformations. Manipulating the three areas below will allow control over your body's weight and fat; although the strategies are simple, you must still work hard and maintain dedication!</p>

 <h2 id="section1">Resting Metabolic Rate</h2>

 
<p> Obtaining a higher resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body burns calories during a period of physical inactivity) is perhaps the most important key in promoting weight loss. The inverse is true if one wishes to gain weight. "Slow metabolisms" do in fact make it easier to gain weight. Too often, we obsess over how we can eat less or exercise more, but the reality is that we are usually at rest during the day. Therefore, the easiest way to lose weight is to make sure that the body passively burns as many calories as possible.</p>
